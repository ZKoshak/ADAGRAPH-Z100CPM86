# A general purpose graphics support library for the Ada programming language hosted on the Zenith H/Z-100 computer
This thesis explores the requirements necessary to develop a graphics support library for the Ada programming language hosted on the Zenith H/Z-lOO microcomputer. A prototype graphics library is implemented in 8086 assembly language embedded in an Ada package. The library operates with JANUS/Ada under the CP/M-86 operating system.

Listings of library routines developed are provided as well as a user's guide and demonstration programs.

It is concluded that an Ada graphics library for microcomputers is feasible and practical.
